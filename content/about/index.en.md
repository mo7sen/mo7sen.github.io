My name is Robear Selwans. I’m a fresh Computer Engineering graduate from Egypt.
As part of my education, I’ve been the programmer on a few student games, a MIPS processor simulator, an offline rasterizer, and a game engine.

I’m interested in a wide variety of things; I can be seen doing whatever I lay my eyes on and think is interesting. I tried developing basic garbage collectors, an exhaustive abstraction layer for the Vulkan API, CPU ray tracers, a VSCode addon (despite not using VSCode as my main editor) to get snippets and syntax highlighting in my engine’s config files. I even tried entering a Dyalog APL contest and managed to answer most of the problems correctly (while simultaneously learning APL from scratch) simply because I thought it’d be fun (and it was).

In my free time, I can be seen:
- Listening to music
- Reading technical e-books
- Reading manga / Watching anime
- Googling random things that I don’t need to know
- Doing crochet (badly)
