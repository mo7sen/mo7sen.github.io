So I started thinking about a game idea until I remembered this clip. I liked the idea of a ninja jumping on missiles while simultaneously destroying them, and that’s what I decided to make.
So the idea was as follows: you’re a ninja in a peaceful village, an army is attacking the village to get rid of its residents and control its resources, you start attacking the missiles that are shot at the village to make sure that none of them reach their target.</description></item></channel></rss>
